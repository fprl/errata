## Why Errata?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Central Registry" icon="list-format">
    Stop scattering `throw new Error` strings across your codebase. Define a single source of truth.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type Safe" icon="approve-check">
    Full TypeScript inference for error details. `props<{ id: string }>()` ensures you never miss data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Runs Anywhere" icon="rocket">
    Zero dependencies. Works in Node, Bun, Deno, Workers, and the Browser.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boundary Ready" icon="random">
    Serialize errors across the network or worker threads without losing type safety.
  </Card>
