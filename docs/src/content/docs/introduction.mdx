description: The philosophy behind Errata.
---

In the publishing world, an **Errata** is a document issued after printing that lists the errors discovered in a book and their corrections. It is a single, authoritative source of truth for mistakes.

In software, we rarely treat errors with this level of respect. We tend to "wing it"—throwing ad-hoc strings (`throw new Error("User not found")`) deep inside functions. These are untyped, hard to track, and impossible for other systems to handle reliably.

**Errata** (the library) brings the publishing concept to your code.

### The Mental Model

Instead of treating errors as control flow exceptions, we treat them as **Data**.

1.  **The Registry:** You define a "Schema" of everything that can go wrong.
2.  **The Details:** You define strictly typed props for each error (e.g., a `userId` is required for a `UserNotFound` error).
3.  **The Usage:** You reference these codes by name.

Whether you are building a CLI, a backend API, or a frontend SPA, this decoupling allows your error logic to travel across boundaries safely.
